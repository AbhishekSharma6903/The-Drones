 - **several SDKs available for developing drone applications** :  
       1.DroneKit  : helps us, create powerful apps for UAVs.  
       2.MAVSDK (MAVLink SDk)   
       3.ROS (Robot Operating System)  

  ### Steps :

       2.Install Mission Planner : Mission Planner is a ground control softwarethat will help you configure and monitor your drone.  
       3.Connect your Drone / Simulate it in Mission Planner.  
       4.Configure Communication Protocol as ArduPilot uses the MAVLink protocol for communication, ensure our SDK supports MAVLink and is configured to communicate using this protocol.
