# Exploring SDKs :
## what is SDK ? :
  - Allow developers to create custom applications and integrate drones into various workflows
  - control the drone, access sensor Data, img/vid processing, Payload control, integration with systems, etc.

## Differenct Types of Drone SDKs:
 1. **DJI SDKs**:  
    - **DJI Mobile** :
        - Platform: Android/iOS
        - Features : Flight control, camera control, live video feed, waypoint missions, intelligent flight modes
        - [Github: DJI iOS SDK](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-iOS)
        - [Github: DJI Android SDK](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Android)
        - [Mobile SDK Doc](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/mobile_sdk_introduction.html)
    - **DJI Onboard SDK**:
        - Connect your onboard computer to a supported DJI vehicle or flight controller using serial port (TTL UART).
        - [official doc](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/introduction/homepage.html)
        - Key Features: Full control of the aircraft, access to flight telemetry, payload management, advanced mission planning.
    - **DJI Payload SDK (PSDK)**
        - allows developers to create custom payloads that can be mounted on DJI drones
        - Provides protocols for communication between the payload and the droneâ€™s internal systems-> flight controller, GPS module, and transmission system1.
        - [Github of PSDK](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Payload-SDK)
        - The latest release version of PSDK is 3.9.0.
    - **DJI Windows SDK**
        - Key Features: Integrate DJI drone control and live video feed into Windows applications.
        - create a customized UWP (Universal Windows Platform) app to unlock the full potential of your DJI aerial platform.
        - The latest SDK version is Public Beta 0.3.2.
        - [Github of Windows SDK](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Windows-SDK)
        - [official site](https://developer.dji.com/windows-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html)
 2.**Parrot SDKs**
    - **Parrot Ground SDK**
        - Platforms: Android, iOS
        - Key Features: Flight control, camera control, media management, live video feed
    - **Parrot Air SDK**
        - Platforms: Embedded systems, Linux
        - Key Features: Advanced drone control, custom payloads, sensor data access
        - you can program and run code directly on the drone using Air SDK,Developers can access built-in drone sensors (IMU, GPS), cameras (front, stereo, vertical), connectivity interfaces (Wi-Fi, 4G).
    - **Parrot Sphinx**
        - Platforms: Linux
        - It lets you develop and test features in a realistic environment without access to a physical drone.
 3.**Auterion (PX4) SDKs**
