## Drones?
 - Called unmaned aerial vehicle (UAV)
 - can be controlled in many ways :
   
       1. Remote control :
           - works on radioFreq (remotes , joysticks)
           - Protocols: PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), PPM (Pulse Position Modulation), SBUS (Serial Bus), and DSMX (Digital Spectrum Modulation).
       2. SmartPhone/Tablet :
           - connection via Wi-fi or Bluethooh.
       3. Ground Control Starion (GCS):
           - Computer or Tab with Softwares eg Mission Planner, QGroundControl etc
           - Protocol: MAVLink (used to send data and commands between vehicles and ground stations)
       4. First Person View (FPV) Control :
           - head-mounted display (HMD) or goggles connected to the drone's camera feed.
           - Low Latency
       5. GPS/Waypoint Navigation :
           - The drone follows pre-programmed GPS coordinates and waypoints.
           - Controlled via a GCS or mobile app.
       6. Voice Control :
           - voice recognition software integrated into a mobile app or GCS.
           -  verbally commands -> control inputs.

       7. Gesture Control:
           - Uses cameras and sensors -> infrared, depth sensors.
       8. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI):
           - Uses EEG (electroencephalography) sensors ->  detect brainwaves
           - Translates specific brainwave patterns into control commands.
## Working Mechanism : 
  - **Motors and Propellers** : thrust + Lift (speed of the motors is adjusted to control movement)
  - **Flight Controllers** : Brain of drone, process data from sensors (gyroscopes, accelerometers, GPS), controls the motors.
  - **GPS and Navigation** : positioning and navigation, Dones can  follow pre-programmed routes or as usual controlled manually.
  - **Batteries** : provied Power to the Drone, flight time and performance
  - **Communication Systems** : drone rec cmds from GS (remote control) and transmit data back. {general case}

## Components and Control Protocols:
  - **Radio Controllers**: use radio freq to comm with drone.(proto : PWM,PPM,SBUS,DSMX)
  - **Telemetry System**: Transmit real-time data from the drone to the ground station, like battery status, GPS coordinates, and flight parameters.
  - **sensors** : gyro, accelero, baro, magneto etc
  - **ECS** : Electronic Speed Control:  Regulate the speed of the motors -> cmd from flight controller.

## Info Pass Flow :

  - Radio -> Receiver (**TX Protocols**): communication between radio transmitter (TX) and radio receiver (RX)

  -  Receiver -> Flight Controler (**RX Protocols**): communication between radio receiver (RX) and flight controller (FC)
  -  Flight Controler -> ESC (**ESC Protocols**)
